It is important to choose your license to make sure that you understand the
terms of the license and that you are following those guidelines as you create
your project. Another reason to make sure to choose a license is that it can
dictate the userbase that contributes back to the project. If there is no
license, most people will not contribute at all.

### 3)
You should not contribute to a project without a license because there could be
possible issues with copyright if there is no explicit license that allows
users to contribute back to the project. On the other hand, if there is an
explicit license, then you understand what is allowed for a possible contributor
to do and what is not allowed.

I do agree with this. While some products may benefit from being a proprietary,
something like the internet that is supposed to be a community for anyone with
access to communicate, it is important to put the consumer first. In the case
of the Gopher, people were unable to put the contributions that they needed
for their use cases and all the development was done by few who did not and
could not realize all of the possible wants of their userbase.

Android uses Apache and kernels use GPL:
This is important for Android to use Apache because of the logo that is found
for Android. The green bot logo is a trademark for Android and is not a part of
the source code. Because of that, it enables users to use the source code, but
restricts the use of the logo.
However, the kernel is under GPL, which makes sense because the kernels
themselves do not require any trademarks and is just includes the source code 
for the kernel itself. Using GPL enforces the kernel and any derivate to be
open for everyone.

### 6)
Our project idea was a course curriculum that is open source. We chose the MIT
license because it is permissive for it is simple and permissive. This was
thought of as a good for this project because it would be allowed for anyone
who wants to teach or learn to follow this curriculum and add to it if they
please.

### 7)
GPL is the best for the community because it enforces all of its software
and any derivate to follow the GPL license. This enforces transparency on the
software to the entire community that is using this project.

LGPL is best for developers and possibly some companies because it is possible
to use portions of an open source code in a larger project, but keep other
parts of the project proprietary. This allows the developer or company keep
parts that they do not wish to be open, to themselves.

Apache is the best for companies because it allows them to keep their
trademarks. This is important for companies because they can restrict userbase
from using their trademarks, but still allow them to use the code.

After part 6, we chose the MIT license and the repo can be found here:

### 9)
A project idea is a meal prep calendar for people who want to track their
caloric intake. By creating a meal prep calendar, people would be able to set
their caloric intake on a week by week basis and have it preset before they
consume their food. This would be used for people interested in tracking their
diet and people who are currently using different programs, but are required to
put in their consumption by the meal.
This would use a MIT license to keep things very permissive.
